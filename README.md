The mapview-location app shows **Google Maps** in a **MapView** and the coordinates of a user selected place.
This process demands the **Permissions** of the **Location** and **Internet**.

## Features
The application requests necessary permissions right from the start. If the user allows the location and interent access, the current location gets marked on the map. 
Clicking on the map marks the other places and reveals their latitude and longitude. The user can always return to the current location via a Button.
